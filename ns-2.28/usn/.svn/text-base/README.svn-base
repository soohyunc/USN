*********************************************************

The Scalable and Secure Transaction (SST) Protocol is a security protocol for
Ubiqutous Sensor Network (USN) with RFID technology. This project is commenced
in part for a summer research internship at LG Electronics (Mobile Communication
Company) in Korea.

This protocol (SST) would suit to a user device which has an RFID capable
communcation with a tag reader. SST mainly covers a secure client-server
transaction with using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for privacy and
integrity protection.

All technical/implementation questions should be directed to Soo-Hyun
Choi, author of SST Protocol, via an e-mail at <s.choi@cs.ucl.ac.uk> or
<s.choi@acm.org>.

Note: The SST protocol's base idea came from Dr. Chan Yeob Yeun (LG
Electronics), and we co-worked to elaborate SST protocol semantics.
