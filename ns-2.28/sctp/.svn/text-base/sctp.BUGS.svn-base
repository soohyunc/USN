- In ProcessSackChunk(), the T3Rtx timer is sometimes restarted for
  destinations that have not acknowledged their first outstanding. The
  code below assumes that if the timer isn't running, then the first
  outstanding for that destination has been acked, but that isn't always
  the case. Reported by Martin Duke <martin.duke@@boeing,com>

      if(spCurrDestNodeData->iOutstandingBytes > 0 &&
	 spCurrDestNodeData->eRtxTimerIsRunning == FALSE)
        {
	  StartT3RtxTimer(spCurrDestNodeData);
        }
