This protocol implementation is the Secure Transaction (SecuTrans) Protocol for Ubiqutous Sensor Network (USN). This project is commenced in part for a summer research internship at LG Electronics (Mobile Communication Business) in Korea.

This protocol (SecuTrans) would suit for a user device which has an RFID capable communcation with a tag reader. SecuTrans mainly covers a secure client-server transaction with the combination of cryptography and hashing for privacy and integrity protection.

All technical/implementation questions should be directed to Soo-Hyun Choi, author of SecuTrans, via an e-mail at <s.choi@cs.ucl.ac.uk>.
