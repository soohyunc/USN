<h1><a href="../README.html">OTcl</a> Change Log</h1>

<h2>Version 0.96 (30 September 95)</h2>

<ol>
<li>Renamed OTclInit to Otcl_Init and versioned AppInit files plus
Makefile so that a dynamically loadable libotcl.so is produced for
loading into tcl7.5. [Potential Incompatibility]
<li>Added OTclGet/Set/UnsetObjectData to allow C api users to associate
clientdata with an object/class pair.
<li>Fixed bug in instvar so that it works properly in conjunction with
uplevel.
<li>Added OTclNextMethod for combining methods from C.
<li>Pruned stack space in OTclDispatch (for a higher recursion limit)
and removed fixed argument limit.
<li>Added OTclSet/Get/UnsetInstVar for manipulating object instance
variables from C.
<li>Added configure scripts and generalized Makefile.
<li>Conditional compilation support for Tcl/Tk 7.3/3.6
<li>Fixed instance variable cleanup when the object is destroyed to
ensure that unset traces are called, with errors reported where
possible, and arrays are cleaned up.
<li>Added OTclAsObject, OTclAsClass for safe casting of method
clientdata to objects and classes.
<li>Renamed OCreate, CCreate, ODelete, and CDelete to fit other naming
scheme, changing Delete return codes in the process. They now return a
Tcl code for better error indication, as well as leave a message in
the interpreter. [Potential Incompatibility]
<li>Pruned object memory layouts for the normal case.
<li>Proc and Instproc methods now remove the method if both the args
and body parameters are empty. [Potential Incompatibility]
<li>Added OTclRemovePMethod and OTclRemoveIMethod for removing methods
from C.
<li>Renamed OTclAddOMethod to OTclAddPMethod for
consistency. [Potential Incompatibility]
<li>Made Otcl_Init safe for multiple calls per interpreter, returning
1 for success, and 0 for repeat initializations.
<li>Added unknown method, which is invoked if regular dispatch
fails. Now the unknown method on Class handles automatic creation.
<li>Added otcl_mkindex, otcl_load, for autoloading support.
</ol>

<h2>Version 0.95 (6 August 95)</h2>

<hr>
Note: Version 0.95 introduces a user visible change. The code of
earlier versions can be updated by changing each <tt>create</tt> proc
to an <tt>init</tt> instproc. The method no longer takes the name of
the object to create, but is invoked on the object just after it is
created and hence maniupulates the object through <tt>self</tt>. This
change was made to regularize method combination with
<tt>next</tt>. Method combination now works in the same way for
classes as for objects.
<hr>

<ol>
<li>Added info default/instdefault option
<li>Support for multiple interpreters
<li>Added array method matching the tcl array command
<li>Separated creation into allocation plus initialization. Now init
instprocs are typically added to classes, while alloc and create are
provided by the system. [Incompatibility]
<li>Removed method combination rule for classes [Potential
Incompatibility]
<li>Objects obtain their name from interpreter and so may be safely renamed
<li>Switched to Get/SetCommandInfo/Name interface
<li>Simplified destroy of classes. Now instances are also destroyed,
and super and sub classes are unlinked from the inheritance
graph. [Potential Incompatibility]
<li>Fixed bug in recovery of superclass method from cycles
<li>Added info subclass option to discover direct subclasses and query
for indirect ones.
<li>Superclass method enforces implicit dependence order. [Potential
Incompatibility]
<li>info heritage takes a match pattern as its final argument
</ol>

<h2>Version 0.94 (24 July 95)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fixed bug in set on classes
<li>Removed unneeded newvar code
<li>Cleaned up documentation errors
<li>Fixed repeat combination bug with next on class procs
<li>otcl.h no longer pulls in tclInt.h
<li>Changed set, unset, instvar implementation to use Tcl_xxVar directly
<li>Any call through Tcl_DeleteCommand triggers proper object cleanup
<li>Fixed bug with info vars
</ol>
